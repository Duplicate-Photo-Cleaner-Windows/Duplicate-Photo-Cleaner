## 🧠 Overview  

**Duplicate Photo Cleaner** is a focused utility designed to help users identify and manage repeated or visually similar images across their Windows systems. Instead of relying only on file names or sizes, the software analyzes visual content to locate photos that look alike—even if they differ in resolution or format.

After scanning selected folders, the application organizes results into clear groups, allowing users to quickly compare images side by side. This approach makes it easier to decide which copies to keep and which to remove, reducing clutter while preserving important files.

The streamlined interface and configurable scan options make Duplicate Photo Cleaner suitable for both everyday users and professionals managing large photo libraries.
